# Core ML and NLP libraries (PyTorch required by spec for transformers models)
# Keep MPS support for Apple Silicon M1 acceleration
torch>=2.4.0,<2.9
transformers>=4.44.0
spacy>=3.7.0
langdetect>=1.0.9

# Data processing - optimized choices
pandas>=2.2.0
numpy>=1.26.0
fastparquet>=2024.5.0  # Lighter than pyarrow (112MB → ~5MB)
scikit-learn>=1.5.0    # Core ML algorithms

# Topic modeling - lightweight approach (no BERTopic stack)
sentence-transformers>=3.0.0  # For embeddings (replaces BERTopic)

# Configuration and utilities
pyyaml>=6.0
click>=8.1.0
tqdm>=4.66.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0

# URL/domain processing
tldextract>=3.6.0

# DEBLOATING NOTES:
# Removed ~500MB (33% reduction: 1.5GB → 1.0GB)
# - bertopic + umap-learn + hdbscan stack → sentence-transformers + sklearn
# - pyarrow (112MB) → fastparquet (~5MB)
# - Development tools moved to requirements-dev.in
# - plotly (65MB) moved to dev (visualization)
# - SymPy (78MB) remains (PyTorch dependency, but unused by pipeline)
